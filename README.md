# Forced Crosswordle Pack

Puzzles in this pack are arranged into groups of similar style. Each group is then arranged in approximate order of increasing length and difficulty.

If a group of puzzles is of a style you don't like, feel free to skip it and try a different group instead.

The styles of puzzles here are fairly diverse, so there should hopefully be something for everyone.

**(Please note that when crosswordle says a puzzle is invalid, this just means at least one word not in the NYT answer list is required to solve the puzzle)**

## Group 1: Puzzles with the fewest possible number of grey tiles:

ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨  
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ©

**Puzzle 3:** https://crosswordle.vercel.app/?puzzle=v1-13,112,94,122,134,242-acmes

## Group 2: Puzzles with the largest possible number of green tiles:

*Brute force will likely be necessary for many words in this group, but the large number of green tiles should keep it manageable.*

ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ  
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¨  
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œ

**Puzzle 6:** https://crosswordle.vercel.app/?puzzle=v1-20,47,182,209,188,242-angle

## Group 3: Puzzles with NYT answer list solutions:

*As words in this group are part of the NYT list, they should be recognisable.*

Puzzles 7, 8 and 9 are puzzles with the fewest number of non-grey tiles which still have a NYT-answer list solution.

â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ  
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ  
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ

**Puzzle 9:** https://crosswordle.vercel.app/?puzzle=v1-9,81,4,163,219,242-rimus

Puzzle 10 is another puzzle using the NYT answer list, this one has a large number of clues so doesn't match the other three, but it has an interesting shape and solve, so I wanted to put it as an extra.

â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨  
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ©â¬œ  
ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨

**Puzzle 10:** https://crosswordle.vercel.app/?puzzle=v1-7,42,88,160,242-leper

## Group 4: Diabolical puzzles

*Puzzles in this group are some of the hardest puzzles I have found using the dataset.*

***The difficulty of puzzles in this group ranges from very hard to diabolical, if you solve any puzzle in this group, good job.***

(If you try solving these, remember that words are *forced*, so for each puzzle, you should look to find any word that works for each row, starting at the bottom and working your way up. You may have to brute force the word in question if you do not know it.)

Puzzles 11 and 12 are forced crosswordles with the smallest number of non-grey tiles ***when not restricted to the NYT answer list***.

â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ  
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨  
â¬œğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ  
â¬œğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ©â¬œ  
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

**Puzzle 12:** https://crosswordle.vercel.app/?puzzle=v1-0,81,1,54,60,242-agmas

Puzzle 12 is actually *the only* 6-row puzzle that is forced by 5 non-grey tiles. All other forced 6-row puzzles have more.

Puzzles 13, 14 and 15 are hand-picked for having certain aspects that result in a difficult solve.

## Final notes

Thanks for viewing this puzzle pack. Hopefully you enjoyed the puzzles contained within \:)

The original idea for this pack was inspired by @Baactiba. You may also thank them for the existence of group 4, as it would not exist if they had not said that they were finding puzzles in a discord server I'm in too easy \:P

The dataset these puzzles were taken from and the python scripts used to generate said dataset are also on github (https://github.com/E-Williamson121/Forced-Crosswordles)
