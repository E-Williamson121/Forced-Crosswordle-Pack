## Group 2: Puzzles with the largest possible number of green tiles:

*Brute force will likely be necessary for many words in this group, but the large number of green tiles should keep it managable \:)*

## Group 3: Puzzles with a small number of colours, but NYT answer list solutions:

*As words in this group are part of the NYT list, they should be recognisable, so no brute force should be required \:)*

## Group 4: miscellaneous puzzles:

Puzzle 10 is another puzzle using the NYT answer list, this one has a large number of clues so doesn't fit in the previous section, but it has an interesting shape and solve, so I wanted to put it as an extra.

Puzzles 11 and 12 are forced crosswordles with the minimum number of colours possible. ***These two puzzles are very hard, as they don't use the NYT list.***
(If you try solving these two, remember that words are *forced*, so you should look to find any word that works for each row, starting at the bottom and working your way up)
