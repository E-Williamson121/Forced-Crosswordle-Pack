## Group 2: Puzzles with the largest possible number of green tiles:

*Brute force will likely be necessary for many words in this group, but the large number of green tiles should keep it managable \:)*

**Puzzle 4:** https://crosswordle.vercel.app/?puzzle=v1-234,235,240,242-zonal

**Puzzle 5:** https://crosswordle.vercel.app/?puzzle=v1-177,222,231,224,242-ocker

## Group 3: Puzzles with a small number of colours, but NYT answer list solutions:

*As words in this group are part of the NYT list, they should be recognisable, so no brute force should be required \:)*

**Puzzle 7:** https://crosswordle.vercel.app/?puzzle=v1-3,36,45,242-facts

**Puzzle 8:** https://crosswordle.vercel.app/?puzzle=v1-3,2,5,92,242-ledum

**Puzzle 9:** https://crosswordle.vercel.app/?puzzle=v1-9,81,4,163,219,242-rimus

## Group 4: miscellaneous puzzles:

Puzzle 10 is another puzzle using the NYT answer list, this one has a large number of clues so doesn't fit in the previous section, but it has an interesting shape and solve, so I wanted to put it as an extra.

**Puzzle 10:** https://crosswordle.vercel.app/?puzzle=v1-7,42,88,160,242-leper

Puzzles 11 and 12 are forced crosswordles with the minimum number of colours possible. ***These two puzzles are very hard, as they don't use the NYT list.***
(If you try solving these two, remember that words are *forced*, so you should look to find any word that works for each row, starting at the bottom and working your way up)

**Puzzle 11:** https://crosswordle.vercel.app/?puzzle=v1-0,1,54,60,242-abash

**Puzzle 12:** https://crosswordle.vercel.app/?puzzle=v1-0,81,1,54,60,242-agmas
